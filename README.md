# Unbound
Repository for the Unbound game engine. This engine is highly WIP with many (most) proposed features still to be developed. The core game engine concepts such as the job system, custom memory allocator and renderer have already begun development. The goal of this personal project is to create software which is both easy to use and efficient, by allowing relatively few paths. Compiling is not recommended, however some interesting bits of code can be found in Camera.cpp, Config.cpp, Terrain.cpp and RenderBackendOpenGL.cpp (all in the Unbound folder)
